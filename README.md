## Planning

### Before creating this project I made a wireframe, visualizing the final product beforehand

- I wanted the game to be fully responsive for different devices, ensuring an optimal and enjoyable experience whether played on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
- I wanted to have kids-friendly cards, featuring adorable animals that would engage young players and create a family-friendly gaming environment.
- I wanted to have a clean popup message when the game finishes, displaying a simple and congratulatory message like "Congratulations! You won!" to enhance the overall user experience.
